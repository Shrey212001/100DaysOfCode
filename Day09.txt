Topic:- Java Output Formatting

Problem:-
In this challenge, we have to read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the 
values according to the instructions in the Output Format section below. 

Input Format
There are three lines of input:
1. The first line contains an integer.
2. The second line contains a double.
3. The third line contains a String.

Output Format
There are three lines of output:
4. On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
5. On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
6. On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
Note: If you use the nextLine() method immediately following the nextInt() method, recall that 
nextInt() reads integer tokens; because of this, the last newline character for that line of integer 
input is still queued in the input buffer and the next nextLine() will be reading the remainder of 
the integer line (which is empty).

Sample Input

Double: 3.1415
Int: 42


Solution:-
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
 int i = scan.nextInt();
 double d = scan.nextDouble();
 scan.nextLine();
 String s = scan.nextLine();
 scan.close();
 System.out.println("String: " + s);
 System.out.println("Double: " + d);
 System.out.println("Int: " + i);
 }
}
