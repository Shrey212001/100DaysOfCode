Queston:-
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Solution:-

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int r=0,n,rev=0;
        n=x;
        if(x<0) return false;
        while(x!=0){
            r=x%10;
            rev=rev*10+r;
            x=x/10;
        }
        return n==rev;
    }
}
