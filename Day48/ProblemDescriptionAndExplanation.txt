Problem:

Java's BitSet class implements a vector of bit values (i.e.:  () or  ()) that grows as needed, 
allowing us to easily manipulate bits while optimizing space (when compared to other collections). 
Any element having a bit value of  is called a set bit.
Given  BitSets,  and , of size  where all bits in both BitSets are initialized to, 
perform a series of  operations. After each operation, print the number of set bits 
in the respective BitSets as two space-separated integers on a new line.


Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers,  (the length of both BitSets  and ) 
and  (the number of operations to perform), respectively. 
The  subsequent lines each contain an operation in one of the following forms:
AND 
OR 
XOR 
FLIP
SET 
In the list above,  is the integer  or , where  denotes  and  denotes. 
 is an integer denoting a bit's index in the BitSet corresponding to.
For the binary operations , , and , operands are read from left to right and the BitSet resulting 
from the operation replaces the contents of the first operand. For example:
AND 2 1
 is the left operand, and  is the right operand. This operation should assign the result of  to .
 
 
Output Format

After each operation, print the respective number of set bits in BitSet  and BitSet 
as space-separated integers on a new line.
