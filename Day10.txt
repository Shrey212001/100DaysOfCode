Topic:- Java Output Formatting-2
Problem:-
Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test 
your understanding of formatting output using printf.

Input Format
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range 
from 0 to 999.

Output Format
In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three 
digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

Sample Input
java 100
cpp 65
python 50

Sample Output
================================
java 100 
cpp 065 
python 050 
================================
Explanation
Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first 
characters. The leading digit of the integer is the character, and each integer
that was less than digits now has leading zeroes.


Solution:-
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
 System.out.println("================================");
 for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
 {
 String s1=sc.next();
 int x=sc.nextInt();
 System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n",s1,x);
 }
 System.out.println("================================");
 }
}
