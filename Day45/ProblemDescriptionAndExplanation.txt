Problem:

Comparators are used to compare two objects.
In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.
The Player class is provided in the editor below; it has two fields:
A string, name.
An integer, score.
Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score;
if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name.
To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface,
then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.



Input Format

Locked stub code in the Solution class handles the following input from stdin:
* The first line contains an integer,n, denoting the number of players.
*Each of the n subsequent lines contains a player's respective name and score.


Constraints

* 0 <= score <= 1000
* Two or more players can have the same name.
* Player names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters.



Output Format

You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout.
Locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object,
use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.


Sample Input
