Topic:- Java Loops

Problem:-
Given an integer, N , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N x I (where 1<=i<=10) should be printed on a 
new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format
A single integer, N .

Output Format
Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1<=I<=10 ) contains the result of N x I in the form:
N x i = result.

Constraints
2<=N<=20

Sample Input
2

Sample Output
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
Explanation
Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first 
characters. The leading digit of the integer is the character, and each integer
that was less than digits now has leading zeroes.


Solution:-
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
 BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 int N = Integer.parseInt(bufferedReader.readLine().trim());
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
{
 System.out.println(N+" x "+i+" = "+N*i); 
}
 bufferedReader.close();
 }
}
